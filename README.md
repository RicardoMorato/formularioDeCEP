## What is this?
This project was made for a challenge, which you can find [here](https://github.com/WoMakersCode/challenges-front-end/issues/1). The idea here is to use some front-end skills to build a form that only has one input field, where you can put your ZIP code (for now it only works for the brazilian, but it will be fixed). After this single input, all fields should be automatically filled with the correct information.

Feel free to test the project, locally or in [this link](https://formdecep.netlify.app/).
